## Who am I?
Pretty normal developer which made different stuff by this point, primarily on **JavaScript**, and more on **NodeJS** than **WebJS**. I use **Python** sometimes, but very rarely
> [!IMPORTANT]
> I may have some issues with correctly writting my messages, and texts *in english*, same common issues are: uncapitalized `i`, missing `'` on words like `dont`, `wont`, etc.  
> My messages may also contain unusual characters mid words, e.g. replacing `o` with `(` and `i` with `*`, please ignore such cases because that means im typing from my phone, which has funky way of typing (**Unexpected Keyboard** on F-Droid)
